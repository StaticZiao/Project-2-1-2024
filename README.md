#### Client Feedback/Choice of Design
+  Client 1 (Darius)
The Home page of the website createad by Hayden looks good, because it has multiple features on the main page of the website. An example of this can be that in the home page there is a clock that actually shows the hour, it has a navbar that says where you are in the website also in addiction it also has the different names of the pages e.g. Home for the home, iPhone for the iphones and other pages correlated to the thing that it was made for. In the home page there is a big title for the Company name, there is a button called Shop Now that if you press it, it would actually show how the shop/company looks like or where it is located. In the home page we can find different products in a special section called Featured Products that would show the products that are in offer. Going to iPhone, there is a multiple choices that can be bought, an example can be the iPhone 15 Pro that is on the website, if you want to buy it then you have to just press the buy now button or if you are not sure you can just press the specs button in this case, that would take you to another page and there you would see all details of the device that you want. Below the phones there are videos of the trailers of the phones. 
Another page of the website is called Nothing because it is taken by the company name nothing and their phones nothing. The layout is the same as the iphone page meaning that I can assume that the other pages of phones may be similar or even equal to these so I will not speak of the page because I have already spoken before however it could be just a decision of the creator of the website.
The same goes for the page called samsung, the website design is similar almost equal but it changes a little bit because of the size of the pictures but apart of that it is the same or it could be the decision of the creator.
The page called xiaomi is the same design as nothing, so I will not say anything more than I already have however it changes because of the pictures size and the actual pictures.
As said before also the design of the page oneplus is the same because it may be the decision of the creator or it could be just for now, the phones are different and the picture size it is different than the other pages.
The page called contact us it is a simple and unique design because it has a actual form that would help the company by the help of the users because if you have a issue with the company or the website than fill the form with your personal information such as email, phone number and the problem and than ti would send it to the company. 
At the end I think that the website meets the purpose that it was meant to be because it has a lot of features that a good website of phone should have such as the spec button to check the information of the phone.


In my opinion the videos of the phone pages had to be in a line and they should have been below the correlated phones.

In my opinion the creator could change the design of each pages so it is not the same design and it also get the theme of the phone itself.
